# Concentric-Harmony
This documentation explains why I created a short animation in P5.JS which centers the concept of circular motion!

With the constraint of only using circles, I sought out to create a short animation that was not representative in nature, but could still communicate emotion. Thus, I chose music that makes me feel at peace, and decided to focus on circles. To me, circles represent wholeness and harmony. However, circular motion has always terrified me as someone who struggled with trig in high school! 
Inspired by meditation content that I use regularly, I wanted to make this a low-interaction composition. The circles would move in and out to simulate and encourage the inhale/exhale of deep breathing. I wanted it to fade out when the music ends as a way to signal the end of the song and add a sense of finality. 
Even though the content of the work is peaceful, the process of making it was anything but! By choosing circular motion, I locked myself into using sine and cosine functions. Oscillation is driven by the sin(time) in order to make the circles grow and shrink, as well as making them move in their radial distance from the center. As a way to acknowledge time passing, I had new circles enter at different time intervals, and they behave in a similar way to the main circles. My hope is that after reading through tons of documentation and watching basic trig youtube videos that I made a cool combination of trigonometric motion and time control in a visually engaging and rhythmic experience!
